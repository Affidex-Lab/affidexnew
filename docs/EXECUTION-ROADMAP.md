## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Post and ghost** - If you post, you MUST engage in comments
2. **Over-post** - 1 post per day max. Quality > quantity
3. **Sound desperate** - Never beg for work, always position as consultant
4. **Ignore DMs** - Respond within 24 hours (use templates)
5. **Forget CTAs** - Every post should have a subtle CTA (Calendly, website, email)
6. **Copy-paste templates** - Adapt to your voice, add personal examples
7. **Neglect social proof** - Get recommendations ASAP
8. **Undercharge** - Your consultancy has value. Don't price like a freelancer.

### ✅ DO:
1. **Show up daily** - Post + engage consistently
2. **Respond fast** - Comments and DMs within 24 hours
3. **Track what works** - Note which posts get engagement
4. **Build relationships** - Engage with the same people consistently
5. **Protect your time** - No free calls. Calendly only.
6. **Be generous with knowledge** - Give value in posts (builds trust)
7. **Stay on brand** - Authority, confidence, results-driven
8. **Follow up** - After sessions, send summaries + next steps

30 days from now, you should have:
- ✅ Optimized authority-driven profile
- ✅ 25-30 high-value posts published
- ✅ 5-10 Calendly bookings

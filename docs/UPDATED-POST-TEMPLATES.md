## 10 READY-TO-USE POSTS (UPDATED)

### 1. AUTHORITY POSITIONING

```
Got an email today: "Can we schedule a preliminary interview to discuss your experience?"

No.

I'm not interviewing for junior roles. I'm not hopping on calls to "see if I'm a fit."

Here's how this works:

→ You tell me about your problem (affidexlab.com/contact)
→ You receive my calendar link
→ We book a session and solve it together
→ You pay for the value I bring

If you want my expertise, I'm here. But we're not doing the "tell me about a time when..." dance.

I respect my time. I respect yours too. Let's talk business, not hypotheticals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're a founder who values direct, high-impact consultancy, let's work.

### 2. CLIENT WIN (PAYOUT SYSTEM)

```
$1.7M transacted. 3,200 active wallets. 100% uptime. Zero hacks.

6 months ago, a creator collective approached us with a problem:

They were manually paying out 500+ contributors every month. Missing wallets. Duplicate transactions. Stuck txs. A mess.

We built them a decentralized batch payout system:

✦ Gas-optimized smart contracts (40% fee reduction)
✦ Admin dashboard with scheduling and failover handling
✦ Real-time monitoring and alerts
✦ Full audit and security review

Today, that system runs itself. 85% reduction in manual workload.

This is what solid engineering looks like: unglamorous, reliable, profitable.

If your Web3 project needs infrastructure that actually works, let's talk.

### 3. CONSULTANCY INSIGHT

```
Just wrapped a 2-hour session with a DeFi founder who's 3 months from launch.

They had the tech. They had the team. But their go-to-market strategy was all over the place.

We spent 45 minutes just on positioning. By the end, they had:

→ A clear ICP
→ 3 strategic partnerships to pursue
→ A grants pipeline worth $150K+

That's the difference between "we're building cool tech" and "we know exactly who needs this and why."

Most founders overcomplicate. The best ones? They get laser-focused and execute.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're 3-6 months from launch and need strategic clarity, let's talk.

### 4. GRANT FUNDING WIN

```
Client just secured $75K in non-dilutive funding.

They'd been rejected twice before. Not because their idea was bad - but because their proposal was weak.

We rewrote it together:

→ Tighter problem definition
→ Clearer milestones
→ Better ecosystem alignment
→ Stronger team positioning

Took 3 sessions. Got approved in 4 weeks.

Non-dilutive funding is the best funding. But you have to speak the language foundations want to hear.

Most founders think "technical roadmap" is enough. It's not.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're applying for grants and getting rejected, you're not writing wrong proposals - you're writing proposals wrong.

### 5. THOUGHT LEADERSHIP (BD STRATEGY)

```
Most Web3 projects treat BD like cold outreach.

They spam 100 VCs. They DM every protocol founder. They "just want 15 minutes."

That's not BD. That's noise.

Here's how strategic BD actually works:

1. RESEARCH ALIGNMENT
→ Who already serves your target users?
→ Which ecosystems benefit if you succeed?

2. CREATE MUTUAL VALUE
→ What can you offer them?
→ Co-marketing? Integration? User flow?

3. BUILD RELATIONSHIPS FIRST
→ Engage with their content
→ Provide value before asking
→ Show up consistently

4. PITCH PARTNERSHIP, NOT CHARITY
→ Frame it as "here's how we both win"
→ Be specific about outcomes

BD is not begging. It's strategy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're stuck on partnerships, let's work together.

### 6. MY CLIENT FILTER

```
I don't work with everyone who reaches out.

Here's my filter:

✅ You have a problem, not just an idea
✅ You have budget (or clear path to it)
✅ You're ready to move in weeks, not months
✅ You value expertise over cheap quotes

❌ You want to "explore possibilities"
❌ You need hand-holding
❌ You're shopping for the lowest bid
❌ You ghost after the first call

I work with 5-7 clients max. I choose carefully.

### 7. PROBLEM-SOLVING STORY

```
Client came to me last week with a "small" smart contract issue.

Their bulk payout function was costing $2,800 in gas per batch. For a DAO paying out 200+ contributors monthly, that's $33K/year just in fees.

We refactored the contract logic, optimized batch sizes, and implemented gas-efficient patterns.

New cost per batch? $680.

75% reduction. Same functionality. Better UX.

Sometimes the "small issues" are the ones bleeding your budget.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If your smart contract feels expensive to run, it probably is. Let's fix it.

### 8. WHY I CHARGE (AUTHORITY)

```
Someone asked me: "Why don't you do free intro calls?"

Because free calls signal:
→ I have time to waste
→ I'm desperate for clients
→ My advice has no value

None of those are true.

When you pay for a session, you:
→ Show up prepared
→ Take the advice seriously
→ Actually implement

Free advice gets ignored. Paid advice gets executed.

I respect my time. I respect your commitment. Let's both show up serious.

### 9. SMART CONTRACT OPTIMIZATION

```
Your smart contract works. But is it optimized?

Here are 5 quick wins to reduce gas costs:

1. USE TIGHT VARIABLE PACKING
→ uint256 → uint128 (if range allows)
→ Save storage slots

2. AVOID REDUNDANT STORAGE READS
→ Cache storage variables in memory

3. USE EVENTS INSTEAD OF STORAGE
→ If you only need off-chain access

4. BATCH OPERATIONS
→ Loop once, not per transaction

5. REMOVE DEAD CODE
→ Every byte costs gas

I've seen 30-50% gas reductions from these alone.

## ABOUT SECTION

```
I don't do preliminary interviews. I solve problems.

If you're here because you need help building, funding, or scaling a Web3 or AI product, you're in the right place. Book a session on my Calendly and let's talk business.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHO I WORK WITH

• Founders who just raised and need a team that ships fast, clean, and on-chain
• VCs and accelerators looking for technical due diligence or portfolio support
• Web3/AI projects stuck between MVP and market fit
• Companies that need smart contract audits, grant writing, or BD partnerships

If you're serious about execution, we speak the same language.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I DO

As Founder of Affidex Lab, I run an incubation lab for core-utility blockchain and AI products. We take ideas from napkin sketches to production-ready systems with real users and real traction.

✦ Smart Contract Development & Audits
✦ Full-Stack Web3/AI Product Engineering
✦ MVP Development & Launch Strategy
✦ Grants Strategy & Non-Dilutive Funding (we write winning proposals)
✦ BD, Partnerships & Go-To-Market
✦ Project Management for Distributed Teams

We've built systems processing $1.7M+ on-chain, designed identity-verified marketplaces, and shipped decentralized payout infrastructure for 3,200+ active wallets monthly - all with 100% uptime and zero security incidents.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

→ I know how to navigate ecosystems (Avalanche, Ethereum, zkSync, Base, etc.)

## FIRST 3 LINKEDIN POSTS (READY TO PUBLISH)

### POST 1: Authority Positioning (Publish Today)

```
Got an email today: "Can we schedule a preliminary interview to discuss your experience?"

No.

I'm not interviewing for junior roles. I'm not hopping on calls to "see if I'm a fit."

Here's how this works:

→ You have a problem
→ You book a session on my Calendly
→ We solve the problem together
→ You pay for the value I bring

If you want my expertise, I'm here. But we're not doing the "tell me about a time when..." dance.

I respect my time. I respect yours too. Let's talk business, not hypotheticals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're a founder who values direct, high-impact consultancy, let's work.

📩 [Your Calendly Link]

### POST 2: Client Success Story (Publish Day 2)

```
$1.7M transacted. 3,200 active wallets. 100% uptime. Zero hacks.

6 months ago, a creator collective approached us with a problem:

They were manually paying out 500+ contributors every month. Missing wallets. Duplicate transactions. Stuck txs. A mess.

We built them a decentralized batch payout system:

✦ Gas-optimized smart contracts (40% fee reduction)
✦ Admin dashboard with scheduling and failover handling
✦ Real-time monitoring and alerts
✦ Full audit and security review

Today, that system runs itself. 85% reduction in manual workload.

This is what solid engineering looks like: unglamorous, reliable, profitable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If your Web3 project needs infrastructure that actually works, let's talk.

### POST 3: Thought Leadership (Publish Day 3)

```
Most Web3 projects treat BD like cold outreach.

They spam 100 VCs. They DM every protocol founder. They "just want 15 minutes."

That's not BD. That's noise.

Here's how strategic BD actually works:

1. RESEARCH ALIGNMENT
→ Who already serves your target users?
→ Which ecosystems benefit if you succeed?

2. CREATE MUTUAL VALUE
→ What can you offer them?
→ Co-marketing? Integration? User flow?

3. BUILD RELATIONSHIPS FIRST
→ Engage with their content
→ Provide value before asking
→ Show up consistently

4. PITCH PARTNERSHIP, NOT CHARITY
→ Frame it as "here's how we both win"
→ Be specific about outcomes

BD is not begging. It's strategy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're stuck on partnerships, book a session. I'll show you the playbook.

## 🔗 YOUR NEW FLOW

1. Someone sees your LinkedIn post
2. They visit your profile
3. They click "Let's Talk Business" in Featured
4. They go to affidexlab.com/contact
5. They fill out form explaining their project
6. They see success message with Calendly link
7. They book a consultation session
8. You show up prepared with their context

**This is premium positioning. This is authority.**

---

## 📞 WHEN PEOPLE ASK

**"How do I work with you?"**
```
Simple:

1. Tell me about your project → affidexlab.com/contact
2. You'll receive my calendar link
3. We book a session and solve it

This way I come prepared with insights specific to what you're building.
```

**"Why not just send your Calendly?"**
```
I want to know what you're working on before we book time.

This way:
→ I come prepared with relevant insights
→ You know I've read your challenge
→ We don't waste time on "not a fit" calls

Quality over convenience.
```

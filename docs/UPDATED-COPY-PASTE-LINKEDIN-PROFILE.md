WHAT I DO

As Founder of Affidex Lab, I run an incubation lab for core-utility blockchain and AI products. We take ideas from napkin sketches to production-ready systems with real users and real traction.

✦ Full-Stack Web3/AI Product Engineering
✦ MVP Development & Launch Strategy
✦ Grants Strategy & Non-Dilutive Funding (we write winning proposals)
✦ BD, Partnerships & Go-To-Market
✦ Project Management for Distributed Teams

We've built systems processing $1.7M+ on-chain, designed identity-verified marketplaces, and shipped decentralized payout infrastructure for 3,200+ active wallets monthly - all with 100% uptime and zero security incidents.

## FIRST 3 LINKEDIN POSTS (UPDATED CTAs)

### POST 1: Authority Positioning

```
Got an email today: "Can we schedule a preliminary interview to discuss your experience?"

No.

I'm not interviewing for junior roles. I'm not hopping on calls to "see if I'm a fit."

Here's how this works:

→ You tell me about your problem (affidexlab.com/contact)
→ You receive my calendar link
→ We book a session and solve it together
→ You pay for the value I bring

If you want my expertise, I'm here. But we're not doing the "tell me about a time when..." dance.

I respect my time. I respect yours too. Let's talk business, not hypotheticals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're a founder who values direct, high-impact consultancy, let's work.

### POST 2: Client Success Story

```
$1.7M transacted. 3,200 active wallets. 100% uptime. Zero hacks.

6 months ago, a creator collective approached us with a problem:

They were manually paying out 500+ contributors every month. Missing wallets. Duplicate transactions. Stuck txs. A mess.

We built them a decentralized batch payout system:

✦ Gas-optimized smart contracts (40% fee reduction)
✦ Admin dashboard with scheduling and failover handling
✦ Real-time monitoring and alerts
✦ Full audit and security review

Today, that system runs itself. 85% reduction in manual workload.

This is what solid engineering looks like: unglamorous, reliable, profitable.

If your Web3 project needs infrastructure that actually works, let's talk.

### POST 3: Thought Leadership

```
Most Web3 projects treat BD like cold outreach.

They spam 100 VCs. They DM every protocol founder. They "just want 15 minutes."

That's not BD. That's noise.

Here's how strategic BD actually works:

1. RESEARCH ALIGNMENT
→ Who already serves your target users?
→ Which ecosystems benefit if you succeed?

2. CREATE MUTUAL VALUE
→ What can you offer them?
→ Co-marketing? Integration? User flow?

3. BUILD RELATIONSHIPS FIRST
→ Engage with their content
→ Provide value before asking
→ Show up consistently

4. PITCH PARTNERSHIP, NOT CHARITY
→ Frame it as "here's how we both win"
→ Be specific about outcomes

BD is not begging. It's strategy.

## ❓ FAQ

### "Do I need to use all the post templates?"
No. Use them as inspiration. Adapt to your voice. Start with 5-7 that feel most natural.

### "What if I don't have client wins yet?"
Focus on thought leadership and consultancy insights. As you get clients, add success stories.

### "How much should I charge for consultancy?"
Start at $200-400 for 60-min sessions. Raise prices every 5 bookings. See EXECUTION-ROADMAP.md for full pricing tiers.

### "Should I respond to every DM?"
Yes, within 24 hours. Use templates from bonus-posts-and-quick-reference.md to save time.

### "What if people think I'm being cocky?"
You're not being cocky - you're being confident. There's a difference. You're positioning yourself as a professional consultant, not a desperate job seeker. The right clients will respect it.

### "Can I still take employment roles if needed?"
Yes, but don't position yourself that way publicly. You can always say "yes" to the right opportunity privately, but your public brand should be consultant-first.

## 🔥 MOMENTUM TIPS

1. **Post at peak times** (7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM in your target audience's timezone)
2. **Engage BEFORE you post** (warm up the algorithm)
3. **Respond to comments quickly** (first 90 mins are critical)
4. **Tag strategically** (mention relevant people/companies when appropriate)
5. **Use hashtags sparingly** (3-5 max, make them relevant)
6. **Pin your best post** (update monthly)
7. **Cross-post to X** (repurpose LinkedIn content as threads)

## 📊 TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

### WEEKLY CHECK-IN:
- How many posts did I publish? (Goal: 5-7)
- Which post got the most engagement?
- How many profile views did I get?
- How many Calendly bookings?
- What adjustments should I make?

### MONTHLY REVIEW:
- Did I hit my KPI targets?
- What content type performed best?
- What should I double down on?

- What experiments should I run next month?

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "My posts aren't getting engagement"
- Are you commenting on other posts BEFORE you publish?
- Are you posting at the right times?
- Is your post too long/salesy/boring?
- Are you using too many hashtags?
- Try: Shorter posts, storytelling, ask questions

### "I'm not getting Calendly bookings"
- Is your CTA clear in every post?
- Is Calendly link in your Featured section?
- Are you following up with people who DM you?
- Try: "Limited slots" messaging, stronger CTAs

### "I don't know what to post"
- Use the 40 templates across the two main content docs
- Adapt them to your voice and experience
- Focus on one content pillar at a time

### "I'm getting overwhelmed"
- Focus on the Quick Start (1 hour)
- Post 3x per week instead of daily (still effective)
- Use templates (don't reinvent the wheel)
- Remember: Consistency > perfection
